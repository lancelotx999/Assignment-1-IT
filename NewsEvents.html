<p>Malaysia Tourism Award for Best Shopping Mall in Sabah and Sarawak
Kuching, Wednesday 26th February – tHe Spring Shopping Mall recently achieved a significant milestone when it won an award for the Best Shopping Mall 2012/2013 in Sabah and Sarawak by the Ministry of Tourism & Culture.</p>

<p>First introduced in 1978 by the Ministry of Culture, Arts & Tourism, The Malaysia Tourism Awards is a prestigious tribute to those who have excelled and supported the development of tourism in Malaysia. It is the highest accolade for individuals and organizations whose outstanding contributions play a significant role in the success of Malaysia’s tourism industry. The awards ceremony was held on 20th February at the KLCC Convention Center in Kuala Lumpur. During the Gala Dinner, the awards were presented to winners by Tourism and Culture Ministry, Datuk Seri Nazri Abdul Aziz.</p>

<p>There are 48 categories in total for the Malaysia Tourism Awards, including Best Hotel Services, Best Restaurants, and Best Tour Operators. tHe Spring Shopping Mall is the only contender from Sarawak to have won an award out of all the categories.</p>

<p>The Management and Staff of tHe Spring Shopping Mall would like to thank the Ministry of Tourism & Culture for honoring them with such a prestigious award, and are also thankful for the support and loyalty of their customers, tenants and business partners – without whom winning this award would not have been possible.</p>

<p>tHe Spring is committed to excellence and continually strives to provide the best for their customers and the community. Being awarded ‘The Best Shopping Mall in Sabah & Sarawak’ is not an easy task especially with so many new malls opening every year in this region. Therefore tHe Spring does not intend to take this for granted or to stop improving their facilities.</p>

<p>This year, tHe Spring has many exciting developments to coincide with Visit Malaysia Year 2014. Many customers and patrons to the mall will notice several upgrading works being done around the mall. The most obvious will be the recently completed renovations to the Main Lift Lobbies from the Basement to the 2nd Floor, and the basement carpark walls. The use of glass cladding, feature ceilings, LED lights and mosaic wall motive results in a more welcoming and brighter lobby area. There are also new ‘Pink Zone’ parking areas in the Basement Carpark. These special parking spots are pink in color and especially reserved for four special categories: handicapped persons, elderly persons, pregnant women, and parents with infants.</p>

<p>tHe Spring Food Bazaar has also been a runaway success since it opened in 2008, providing customers with great food choices in a relaxed and comfortable environment. Customers can expect a brand new Food Bazaar on the 1st floor in May, complete with a fresh, contemporary design but with the same great food and value. More than RM6 million is invested into the new Food Bazaar including the engagement of an award-winning architect.</p>

<p>The reshuffling of shops and tenants is also ongoing right now with many customers noticing and asking why their favorite shops have moved. This is to facilitate the space needed to house three major global brands opening in tHe Spring this year. Just like in 2008, when tHe Spring first brought in several never-before-see-in-Sarawak brands like Loccitane, Padini, Starbucks, Esprit and MBO Cinemas, they are doing it again in 2014 with three brands that are bound to excite young and fashion-forward customers.</p>

<p>In June, Kuching will see the introduction of a luxury leather goods brand making their first appearance in Sarawak. Then in September, we will see the opening of a French cosmetics store, and finally in November, there will be a grand launching for a large clothing retailer, also making their first appearance in Sarawak.</p>

<p>Ongoing renovation works and upgrading will continue on into 2015, with the redesign of the outdoor carpark and alfresco area. With all these plans in place, tHe Spring is confident in meeting the needs and wants of the public and its customers for many years to come and to secure its place as a premier shopping and lifestyle destination for both locals and tourists.</p>
